<a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/EASE/Scripts">Original Source</a>
<p>An alternate way to manage your scripts is to provide locations, where EASE can parse for scripts. You may add such locations in the preferences / Scripting / Script Locations. Currently we support workspace folders, file system paths, http URIs to some extent and platfom:/plugin URIs. In the future additional URIs will be supported like ftp, ...
EASE searches those locations on a regular basis and displays found scripts in the Scripts Explorer View. From there you may edit or execute them directly. Furthermore you may access such scripts using the script:// scheme.
The Script Shell View is capable of recording your actions and store them to the default Script Location. Recording can be enabled in the view toolbar.
</p><p>Scripts support magic headers, a comment section at the very beginning of the file containing key:value pairs. Changes are reflected immediately for workspace resources or after a refresh triggered in the Script Explorer view.
Supported keys are:
